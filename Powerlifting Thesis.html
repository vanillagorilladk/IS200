                        <p>    As a man, you need to be strong. In every civilization across the globe, there has been and will be a need for strong men. A big strong man will always be more useful than a weak frail man. Push-ups do not make you strong. Sit-ups do not make you strong. Running does not make you strong. What makes you strong is the squat, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, and pull-ups.</p>
                        <p>    I believe that as a man, you need to be able to pick heavy things up off the floor, that's the deadlift. You need to push heavy things around over your head and in various angles, that’s the bench and overhead press. You need to tie everything together with a strong core, strong hips, strong legs, and a strong butt, that’s the squat. Strength training with 3-6 reps develops what is called basic strength, the underlying ability of the muscle to produce force. After developing this basic strength by taking advantage of progressive overload for 6 months to a few years, then you can start pinpointing specific areas you want to improve through accessory movements but do not bother yourself with these until you perform compound strength movements (Squat, Bench, Press, Deadlift, Pullup) for months on end. </p>
                        <p>    Squat is the pinnacle of becoming a strong human. If you just squat and do nothing else, everything else gets stronger. And I'm not talking about sets of 10-15 reps with a lighter weight. When you load a heavy enough weight on the bar that you will hurt yourself and fail if you do not demonstrate perfect form, perform 3-6 reps with proper bracing and technique. Then do 3-5 sets 2-3 times a week and do that for 6 months. Assuming that your diet includes red meat, dairy, fruits, veggies, and other natural whole foods, I promise you that your body will be unrecognizable. Your shoulders will get broader, your butt will thicken, your quads will start to make your pants tight, and your traps will begin to push through your shirt. But most importantly, you will learn how to perform under heavy stress and maximal load. Also, you will be more disciplined, and you will learn what it is like to overcome adversity. All this improvement just from getting underneath a heavy squat bar.</p>
                        <p>     While other muscles will grow with squats, they will not grow as optimally as if you were performing the deadlift, the bench press, overhead press, and pull-ups. Do these movements with the same intensity, and relative load as the squat. 
                                 When strength training, the most effective rep is the last rep of the last set when you feel like passing out and giving up. If you can find something within you to push through and finish then you will succeed in every area of your life
                            </p>
                        <p>    Your body does not know that it is lifting weights, all your body knows when you are fighting that weight, is that it needs to grow and get bigger so that when that load comes again, it can be strong enough to not die. Heavy weights are a threat to your body, if you expose yourself to that threat repeatedly then your body will respond and get larger.
                                 Everyone on earth, but especially young men should be strength training. It teaches discipline, hard work, sacrifice, overcoming adversity, and grit. I believe what I just explained should be taught in elementary schools, and middle schools, and performed in high school and beyond. Mandatory fitness classes where students learn compound strength movements are so much more beneficial than running the pacer, doing pushups, or performing sit-ups ever will be. Strong humans get things done.
