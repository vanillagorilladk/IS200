                        <p>Growing up overweight, I always thought that being in shape was impossible. I always thought that you were either fat or skinny and there was nothing I could do about it. Oh how was I wrong.</p>
                        <p>I was always an active kid, I played soccer, baseball, basketball, and rugby. I quickly realized that rugby was going to be my main sport. But I was too fat to be any good. Until eighth grade, I really didn't make an impact to my team. The winter before my eighth-grade season I remember watching the movie Rocky, specifically the training scene where he was jump-roping super fast, and the mixture of his training and the music inspired me to get in shape and be a better version of myself. That winter I bought a jump rope and got to work. I exercised every day to lose weight, and I also watched what I ate very closely. I ended up losing about 40 pounds that winter and I became much better at rugby.  
                        </p>
                        <p>To become the best rugby player I could be, I knew I had to get bigger, so I did countless hours of research on how not only to get bigger, but stronger, This is how I discovered powerlifting. Throughout high school, I would continue to lift weights and power lift. My senior year I was our club MVP and was MVP of the state championship game which we won. We also went on to win nationals. The reason I became so good was through literally becoming the strongest player on the field and running through people. This fall I will be going to play rugby for the United States Military Academy, and I know I would not have this opportunity if it weren't for powerlifting.
